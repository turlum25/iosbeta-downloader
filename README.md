# iOS Beta IPSW Downloader

This program is built on Python 3.13 and is currently in very early alpha stages. This application focuses on new legacy iOS downgraders trying to find iOS beta IPSW files for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.

# Device compatibility

Currently, only iPod1,1 (iPod touch 1) is supported. 

# How to run

I have currently only used Python 3.13, other versions may work but I'm not sure yet.

# Where did i get all the files from?

It is located in archive.org/details/Apple_iPod_Firmware

# More stuff

I will be allowing anyone to be using and creating forks of this project. I aim to only make this a very simple, out-of-the-box program which just downloads your beta IPSWs.


# Pros and cons

iOS beta versions download a lot faster than they do in the usual browser. But some beta iOS versions may be expired and you may not be able to activate them.

# Upcoming updates

Version 0.3 will add iPod2,1 support and more clean UI.
